## About
The game Asteroids and Aspirations is a visual novel with a point-and-click game style. The user views the environment in first person view and has
 mechanics to roam around as the character, make decisions, and complete tasks and mini-games to advance the story-line.
As the player progresses, their choices will ultimately determine which kind of ending they receive at the end of the game’s narrative.

Journey through the far reaches of space in “Asteroids and Aspirations”. Take the helm as the captain of a spaceship where you and your loyal crewmates – J9F4, Ixel,
N’Mosa, Yssa, and Comet - are traveling to the asteroid Psyche. But this will be no ordinary trip.  The research facility on the asteroid is in shambles, and it is up to you to fix it.
Explore the ship and play minigames that help you find parts to fix the research facility. Learn about your crewmates and guide conversations that will set their future.
Most importantly, learn about why the Psyche asteroid is important, and why NASA is sending a satellite in the summer of 2022 to research the unique entity.
The things you learn, the decisions you make decide the outcome of your journey. Will there be love and happiness? Or will there be ruin? You will decide.
Are you ready for adventure?
